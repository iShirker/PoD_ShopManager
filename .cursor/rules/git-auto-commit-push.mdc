# Git auto-commit and push

After each prompt that results in **code or config changes**:

1. **Stage** changes: `git add` for all modified/new files, but **exclude** `frontend/dist` (build artifacts). Example:  
   `git add backend/ frontend/index.html frontend/src/ frontend/style-samples/` (or equivalent paths); optionally `git restore --staged frontend/dist` to unstage dist if it was added.

2. **Commit** with a clear message. Use your **output summary** (what you implemented, fixed, or changed) as the commit message. Prefer a short subject line, then a bullet list of changes. Example:
   ```
   Add X and fix Y

   - Implemented X with ...
   - Updated Y to ...
   - Excluded frontend/dist from commits
   ```

3. **Push**: `git push`.

If there are no changes, or the user explicitly asks not to commit, skip these steps.
