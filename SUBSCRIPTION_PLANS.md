# PoD Shop Manager – Subscription Plans

## Overview

Subscription plans are designed for **solo PoD sellers** at different stages: **new sellers** ($0 revenue), **growing sellers** ($0–$5k/month), and **established sellers** ($5k–$10k+/month). All plans use a **monthly subscription** model. **Per-transaction fees** apply only when the app incurs extra costs (e.g. AI, heavy storage, mockup generation above limits).

**Price range**: $19.99 – $99.99/month.
